<h2 align="left">- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bilal0chehab<br><br>Hello, I am Bilal, a highly accomplished professional with a diverse educational background and a strong focus on neurobiology, psychology, and computational neuroscience. I hold a Master's degree in Neursopsychology and applied computational neural systems, which equipped me with a deep understanding of the brain's functions and its relationship with advanced computational techniques.<br><br>One of my notable achievements is my contribution to a cutting-edge project, where I worked on developing an automated system for the precise alignment and counting of neuronal cells in histological samples. This project showcased my expertise in both neuroscience and programming, highlighting my ability to bridge the gap between the two disciplines effectively.<br><br>Furthermore, my academic journey reflects a continuous pursuit of knowledge and growth. I hold a Bachelor's degree in biology and an advanced diploma in psychology and counseling, demonstrating my multidisciplinary approach to understanding human behavior and cognition.<br><br>Over the past four years, I have honed my teaching skills, gaining valuable experience in classrooms with students of different age groups. This experience has not only enhanced my ability to effectively communicate complex ideas but also provided me with valuable insights into various learning styles.<br><br>In addition to my academic achievements, I possess a solid foundation in programming, particularly in Python and Matlab, which has been instrumental in my work and research. My enthusiasm for programming and data analysis has led me to pursue a forthcoming three-year program in Applied Artificial Intelligence, which promises to further expand my skill set.<br><br>With an innate curiosity and passion for learning, I am always eager to explore new subjects and technologies, making me a proactive and adaptable professional. My keen interest in automated systems, data analysis, and programming further enriches my capabilities and opens doors to innovative approaches in problem-solving and artificial intelligence.</h2>
